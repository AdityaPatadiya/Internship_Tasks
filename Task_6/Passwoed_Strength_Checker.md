## Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity

| Password       | Complexity Level             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `password123`  | Low                          |
| `MyCatIsCool`  | Medium                       |
| `M1!cR0$0ft`   | High                         |
| `T!9&zQ@p^Ls7` | Very High                    |
| `Abcdef`       | Low (short + only lowercase) |

## 2. Include Variations:

Uppercase: e.g., `MyPassword`

Lowercase: e.g., `mypassword`

Numbers: e.g., `password123`

Symbols: e.g., `P@ssw0rd!`

Length: Try short (6 chars), medium (10 chars), and long (16+ chars)

## 3. Test Each Password on Strength Checkers

Use online tools like:

Password Monster

Kaspersky Password Checker

Bitwarden Password Strength Tester

How Secure Is My Password

For each password:

Checking the score or time to crack

Note feedback (e.g., "too short", "add symbols", "common word")

##  4. Record Results
| Password    | Score / Crack Time | Feedback                |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| password123 | Very weak / 2 sec  | Common word, no symbols |
| M1!cR0\$0ft | Strong / 5 years   | Good mix of characters  |
| Abcdef      | Weak / 3 sec       | Too short, no variety   |

## 5. Identify Best Practices

Based on results, extract what makes a password strong:

Use at least 12–16 characters

Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid dictionary words or common patterns

Use unpredictable combinations

## 6. Write Down Tips

You can note tips like:

❌ Avoid names, dates, or common phrases.

✅ Use passphrases (e.g., Sun!s3t-R3d_D0g2025)

✅ Use a password manager to store complex passwords.

✅ Enable 2FA where possible.

## 7. Research Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brute Force**         | Tries all possible combinations until it succeeds.           |
| **Dictionary Attack**   | Tries words from a dictionary (like "password", "hello123"). |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked credentials on different sites.                  |
| **Phishing**            | Tricks you into entering your password.                      |

## 8. Summarize Impact of Complexity on Security

> "Password complexity significantly increases resistance against brute-force and dictionary attacks. A strong password with length, randomness, and mixed characters can take centuries to crack, while a simple password may fall within seconds. Therefore, using complex, unique passwords for every service is essential for online security."
